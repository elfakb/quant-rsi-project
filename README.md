**QuantRSI** is a  real-time big data pipeline designed to simulate (not real) algorithmic trading strategies. It gets high-frequency cryptocurrency price data calculates technical indicators (RSI) using **Apache Spark Structured Streaming** and visualizes the signals on a live **Streamlit** dashboard.

---


##  Project Overview

QuantRSI is a real-time data pipeline built to simulate algorithmic trading. It processes high-frequency cryptocurrency data to detect trading opportunities instantly.

The system stages:
1.  **Ingestion:** Streaming raw price data using **Kafka**.
2.  **Processing:** Calculating RSI indicators on the data with **Spark Structured Streaming**.
3.  **Visualization:** Displaying live "Buy/Sell" signals on a **Streamlit** dashboard.

## 🏗 System Architecture

The pipeline is designed as a decoupled, microservices-oriented architecture running entirely within a **Docker** environment.

### What is RSI?
The **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. It measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions.

* **Range:** 0 to 100.
* **Overbought Zone (Signal: SELL):** When RSI > 70. This suggests the asset may be overvalued and a price correction (drop) is likely.
* **Oversold Zone (Signal: BUY):** When RSI < 30. This suggests the asset may be undervalued and a price rebound (rise) is likely.
* **Neutral Zone:** Between 30 and 70.


### Synthetic Data Simulation
**⚠️ Important Note:** This project is a **simulation** intended for educational and engineering purposes.

## Running


````markdown
##  Running the Pipeline

To run the full simulation, you will need **4 separate terminal windows**. Follow this specific order to ensure all components connect correctly.

### 1️⃣ Terminal 1
Start the Kafka, Zookeeper, and Spark containers in the background.
```bash
docker-compose up -d
````

### 2️⃣ Terminal 2: 

Start generating synthetic crypto data. This will also automatically create the necessary Kafka topics.

```bash
python producers/crypto_producer.py
```

### 3️⃣ Terminal 3: 

Start the Spark Structured Streaming job to calculate RSI in real-time.

```bash
python spark_engine/main_processor.py
```

### 4️⃣ Terminal 4: Dashboard (Consumer)

Launch the web interface to visualize the data.

```bash
streamlit run dashboard_app.py
```

-----

### Stopping the Project

To stop the simulation and remove the containers (cleaning up resources):

```bash
docker-compose down
```
